* Kwabena Adu-Duodu is a 4th year PhD Computer Science student at Newcastle University, UK.



A brief about Kwabena's PhD research
======
His PhD research is a multi-disciplinary one involving leveraging Industry 4.0 technologies for sustainability in construction supply chains. In particular his research has involved primarily using:
* Semantic technologies (e.g. Protégé, Stardog, Ontotext GraphDB)
* Blockchain technology (Polkadot)

To implement a technological system that:
* Provides construction product provenance by connecting distributed and(or) isolated product life cycle data.
* Determines the end-of-life handling of construction products using customisable SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) rules.
* Supports automated compliance assessment flows of products and incorporating human oversight to ensure products are safe for reuse.
* Leverages polkadot technology for a trusted, interoperable, cloud-based,  compliance assessment platform.

Details of this work will be published online on the Newcastle university [theses website](https://theses.ncl.ac.uk/jspui/) once he completes his PhD.

Research Interests
======
* Cloud Computing
* IoT
* Blockchain
* Semantic technologies
* Distributed Systems

He is currently looking at expanding his research acumen to leverage ontology-assisted AI decision making. Key terms for this will include: Ontology-Augmented Generation (OAG), Ontology-Grounded RAG (OG-RAG), GraphRAG and Neuro-Symbolic AI. 

Open for job roles
======
* Currently searching for a Post-doctoral/ Research Scientist position to start in September 2026.
* Also open for computer science project collaborations.
